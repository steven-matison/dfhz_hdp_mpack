# Specifies the address to which the Kibana server will bind. IP addresses and host names are both valid values.

# Enables you to specify a path to mount Kibana at if you are running behind a proxy.
# Use the `server.rewriteBasePath` setting to tell Kibana if it should remove the basePath
# from requests it receives, and to prevent a deprecation warning at startup.
# This setting cannot end in a slash.
#server.basePath: ""

# Specifies whether Kibana should rewrite requests that are prefixed with
# `server.basePath` or require that they are rewritten by your reverse proxy.
# This setting was effectively always `false` before Kibana 6.3 and will
# default to `true` starting in Kibana 7.0.

# If your Elasticsearch is protected with basic authentication, these settings provide

# is proxied through the Kibana server.

# These files validate that your Elasticsearch backend uses the same key files.

# Optional setting that enables you to specify a path to the PEM file for the certificate
# authority for your Elasticsearch instance.
#elasticsearch.ssl.certificateAuthorities: [ "/path/to/your/CA.pem" ]

# To disregard the validity of SSL certificates, change this setting's value to 'none'.

# Time in milliseconds to wait for Elasticsearch to respond to pings. Defaults to the value of

# Logs queries sent to Elasticsearch. Requires logging.verbose set to true.
